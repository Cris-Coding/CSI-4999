      <h2>Oakland University Student Congress</h2>
      <p>
        I had the pleasure of serving as a legislator in OU Student Congress for two semesters, and I learned a lot from the position,
        got to engage with the campus in a way I never had before, and met students from all majors and backgrounds. I had a great time as a 
        legislator and it was great to give back to the campus.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey all, my name is Lucas Sirbu and I'm an upcoming Computer Science graduate. I love anything and everything
            creative, from reading, writing, and playing DnD with friends. I also love 80's sci-fi movies like Total Recall, and I'm currently
            reading the Dune novels.
